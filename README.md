# Word Guess Game

This is a front-end hangman-style game for the web built with HTML, CSS, and javascript. Words to guess are chosen from a pre-defined array of country names. The array is shuffled each time you reach the end so that you can start over in a different order.

The game is live [here](https://victoriaashling.github.io/wordGuessGameWeb).
